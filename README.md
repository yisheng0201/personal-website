# Personal Portfolio Website  
#### Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/7JPvrpUrTkg>  
#### Description:

This is a personal portfolio website created as my final project for Harvard's CS50x course. The purpose of this site is to introduce myself—YiSheng Tang—and demonstrate the foundational web development skills I've learned during the course. The website is built using HTML and CSS, with modern web standards in mind, and is deployed using GitHub Pages for accessibility.

The homepage features a hero section that includes my name, a short self-introduction, and a professional headshot image optimized in `.webp` format for better performance. Below that, the website contains additional sections: Skills, Testimonials, and Contact. These sections are all linked via a responsive navigation bar that remains accessible on various screen sizes.

The Skills section visually highlights my current learning path, including beginner-level knowledge in Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, SQL, and C. Each skill is accompanied by a corresponding logo image. While I am still early in my programming journey, this website acts as both a portfolio and a learning milestone, showing my ability to structure and style a responsive website.

The Testimonials section is placeholder content for now but is designed to accept real testimonials in the future. The Contact section includes a styled contact form that allows users to submit their name, email, and message. While the form does not yet include back-end functionality, it lays the foundation for future integration with services like Formspree or Flask-based email forwarding.

### Features:
- Fully responsive layout using Flexbox
- Semantic HTML structure
- Font Awesome icons integration for visual enhancement
- Google Fonts (Poppins) for modern typography
- Custom CSS variables for consistent theming
- Optimized image formats (`.webp`) for faster load times
- Contact form layout with styled input fields and submission button
- GitHub link for code access
- Clean code organization and modular CSS

### Technologies Used:
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Flexbox and variables)
- Font Awesome (via CDN)
- Google Fonts
- Git and GitHub for version control and deployment
- Live Server (Visual Studio Code extension) for local development
- YouTube for project demo hosting

### Skills Represented in Site:
I currently have beginner-level experience in:
- Python
- Flask
- HTML & CSS
- SQL
- C Programming

These technologies were introduced through CS50x, and I’m continuing to build my understanding through hands-on projects like this one. Though the site is relatively simple, it represents my foundation in software development and web design.

### Project Structure:
- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the content and layout.
- `style.css`: Custom stylesheet with all layout and design rules.
- `/images`: Folder containing my headshot and skill-related images (e.g., Python, HTML, SQL logos).
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the project purpose, structure, and features.

This project represents my first independently styled website from scratch and marks the beginning of my web development journey.
